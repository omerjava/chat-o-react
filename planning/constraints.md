# Constraints

Some boundaries around the project.

## External

- Project must be completed in two weeks, it is a tight schedule to build a full stack application with
a lot of features.
- Strapi in the backend and React in the frontend must be used. Getting familiar with all features of
these two technologies may take time.

## Internal: Involuntary

- I push myself too much. It causes sometimes inefficiency.

## Internal: Voluntary

- There are also other subjects which I want to study and focus on. So, I want to finish this project as quick as possible.
